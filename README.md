# landing-page
Landing Page is a project designed to test my knowledge and ability with CSS so far as well as my research methodology to learn what has not yet been taught to me. I was surprised to find that I was no longer brute-forcing margins to fit the design protocol. After so much repetition and problem-solving the methods started to fall into place and, while I did do a lot of reading and googling to finish this project, I really enjoyed the process of finishing this work.

If you'll humor me to hear my epic fail anecdote:
One incredible fumble occurred at the very beginning in attempting to link my external CSS page to my HTML page. In short, it simply wouldn't. I spent hours on this problem. Probably the whole of two hours googling, reading, trying different combinations of: "type" "href" "source"; different file paths, encoding methods, pouring over posts and posts on stackoverflow going back years and years, filtering my google search to only the most cutting edge in CSS (surprisingly it's jquery and I haven't gotten there yet) only to find, finally, mercifully, that I had placed my "link" tag too far down the header. I bashfully highlighted the humble line of code and dragged it to its rightful place at the very beginning of my "head" tag. And it worked. I was off. After that, the rest was like a mystery/puzzle game. It's starting to get fun.
